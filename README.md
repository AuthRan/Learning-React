# 🚀 React JS Journey — Chai aur Code

Welcome to my personal React learning repo!  
This repo contains all the projects, practice code, and mini assignments I built while learning **React.js** from the **Chai aur Code** YouTube channel by Hitesh Choudhary.

## 🧠 What is this repo?

This is a collection of:
- Mini projects
- Practice components
- Core React concepts (hooks, props, state, etc.)
- Custom experiments

Each folder typically represents a day or topic from the playlist.
